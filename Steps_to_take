While most tutorials of vaultwarden password manager installation suggest the docker way, which is cool indeed. Yet, there is another way, perhaps cooler way.
On an Ubuntu-based OS, snapd comes in stock. So do the following command to install vaultwarden password manager:
sudo snap install vaultwarden
The instance of vaultwarden is now listening on port 8000 of the localhost.
Next, use nginx reverse proxy to present your vaultwarden to the outside world.
It may mean adding a proxy_pass line to your nginx configuration file, or setting up a new reverse proxy site through your control panel.
If things go well, the whole process takes less than 2 minutes.
